The circles drawn on a HTML5 canvas represents different planets. Their orbit speed ratio is based off actual data and gives the animation a simple visual comparison, for example it takes Mars roughly twice as long to complete a orbit around the sun. Rather than leaving the orbit path blank I opted to draw strings of faint circles for each path. The animation is scaled down in the vertical axis giving it an added effect of depth. I've also added a MouseOver eventListener to make the animation interactive, it changes a planet's color red and display its name when the mouse is hovered over it.

Each layer was given a unique velocity depending on its y position, this gave the animation an interesting helix-like effect.

I\u2019ve received useful feedback from users; I have decided to implement some of these requested features. First, a simple way to view the number of similar tabs prior to activing the close action was requested. I\u2019ve decided to implement a dynamic counter right into the drop-down menu which is displayed when any tab is right-clicked. It works by listening for the right-click event on a tab, once activated, all open tabs are parsed; similar tabs are tallied and displayed in brackets next the Close Similar Tab menu item. The second new feature is a confirmation before closing multiple tabs. Due to limitations of the WebExtensions API, I could not use a traditional windows dialog box similar to ones found on desktop applications, In order to mimic a dialog box, the extension opens a small browser window displaying an HTML page. The small window will ask for confirmation to close multiple tab and it will display the number of tabs affected. The window will also include UI elements such as buttons and checkboxes and the option for users to diable the feature in case they do not wish to see the dialog box again. The extension\u2019s Options page was also updated with the ability to toggle on/off the confirmation dialog."},{break:1},{link:"Download the Add-on for Firefox here",src:"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-similar-tabs/"},{break:2}],image:[{src:"images/closeSimilarTabs2screenshot.png",type:"rounded",link:"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-similar-tabs/",className:"border border-dark"}]},{id:3,title:"Firefox Extension, Close Similar Tabs",date:"2/3/2018",body:[{text:"My browser of choice is Mozzila Firefox. I find it to be fast, stable, user-friendly and I appreciate the open-source nature of the browser. I enjoy the many community developed browser extensions available online however there was one feature I really wish I had and could not find any suitable alternative. That is the ability to close multiple tabs of a specific website. When I browser the internet I tend to jump from one link to another by opening a new tab and leaving the previous tab open just in-case I need to jump back quickly without losing my place. Due to this habit the number of open tabs in the browser quickly increases to dozens or even hundreds over time and when it finally comes time to do a little \u201cclean-up\u201d I rather not visit every single open tab to make a decision of either closing it or leaving it open; at times I would like to close all tabs from one specific website. Thus I decided to develop a solution, the \u201cClose Similar Tabs\u201d extension. This small extension adds a feature to the drop-down menu activated when a user right-clicks any tab. The option \u201cClose Similar Tabs\u201d will parse through all open tabs and closes one which are similar to the activated tab with a single click!"},{break:1},{text:"I developed this extension using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and the "},{link:"WebExtensions API",src:"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions"},{break:2},{link:"Download the Add-on for Firefox here",src:"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-similar-tabs/"},{break:3}],image:[{src:"images/closeSimilarTabsScreenShot.png",type:"rounded",link:"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-similar-tabs/"}]},{id:2,title:"Python script, Correlation between GDP per capita versus number of Secure Internet Servers in 2016",date:"8/20/2017",body:[{text:"The Woldbank not only offers economic metrics such as income levels and national GDP of various countries, it also has interesting statistics on topics such as infrastructure, health, social development and technology.

In this dataset there are some outliers including nations such as Switzerland, Iceland, Netherlands and Korea where the number of internet servers hosted there are higher when compared to other nations of similar GDP per capita. Examples of the opposite can also be seen for nations where the number of internet servers are comparably less than other nations of similar GDP per capita. Macao, China is an outliner which can be partially attributed to its state status.
